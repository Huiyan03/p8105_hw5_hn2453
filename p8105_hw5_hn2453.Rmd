## Problem 1
Write the function to check whether there are duplicate birthdays in the group with fixed group size.
```{r}
group_size = 2:50

birthdays = 1:365

dup_birthday = function(n){
  
  assign_birthday = sample(birthdays, n, replace = TRUE)

  return(anyDuplicated(assign_birthday)!=0)
  
}

```

Run previous function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50
```{r}
set.seed(1)

simulations = 10000

prob = array(2:50, dim = c(49))
for(n in group_size){
  count = 0
for(i in 1:simulations){
  if(dup_birthday(n)){
    count = count + 1
  }
  
}
  prob[n-1] = count/simulations
}

prob

```
Make a plot showing the probability with different group size.
```{r}
plot(prob,xlab="Group Size",ylab="Probability",)
```
